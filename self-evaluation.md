# How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
Arrays has been my favorite assignment so far, while it took me longer to complete it also felt very logical. In the process, I made quite a few mistakes but was able to research and fix them along the way. I feel quite confident with the content covered, however I know there is still a lot more to it.
# Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
At this point, I do feel confident before moving on. I've spent quite a bit of time "playing" around during this lesson so I feel like I have a better understanding of all of our work up to this point because of it.
# What questions do you have about Arrays?
In the lesson, it was indicated that in Ruby it is possible but not suggested to have elements of different types in an array. I did think of one time it may be useful, using my example of the coffee shop if in the 'price' array I wanted to add a "free" string to the existing float elements. Is this an example which it may be appropriate to use differing elements?
